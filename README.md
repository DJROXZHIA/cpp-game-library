# cpp-game-library

A simple C++ game library I created while learning OpenGL.

To build, just open the .sln file and build the project in visual studio. You can then use the generated .lib file in your own projects.

It implements an Entity Component System using entt. [https://github.com/skypjack/entt]

It can handle all basic features such as audio, animation, particles, events, GUI, physics and tilemaps.

This is a learning project. Some parts may be incomplete or buggy.
